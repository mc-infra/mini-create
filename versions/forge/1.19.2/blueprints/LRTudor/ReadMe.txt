Read Me: Thanks for downloading and trying out this years long endeavor that is my first attempt at a Minecolonies schematic pack.
This pack is a modular design, all exterior buildings are decorations while the interiors are huts. Each hut is keyed to the 
building that it belongs to. While I did my best to sort out any issues with interiors breaking exterior parts, I still might have missed something.
That being said every piece, to the best of my knowledge, has been tested. 
You'll find roads, boulevards, canals, with and without sewers. A mining tunnel system, variant outer buildings, roofs, stairwells, and everything
else you'd expect from a schematic set. Only materials found in the official server pack were used, most importantly Donum Ornamontum (sic). 
A few points: to ensure that buildings remain intact, always build the exterior buildings first, before placing interiors. This includes roofs, but not facades.
Some interiors do not have an attached exterior, while designed to fit into the main flat buildings, they can also be placed on the top of buildings under
the greenhouse roofs. Each unit can be used independently if you want to build your own structure, and I included the RAW original builds in the RAW folder
if you want to make your own changes. 

Have fun.
